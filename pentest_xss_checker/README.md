# pentest_open_redirect_checker
```
# Script takes a number of URLs and attempts to check them for open-redirect using www.example.com and 
# www.google.com as base, aka the payload is provided and if the example.com or www.google.com content 
# can be seen in response, then it will be assumed that open-redirect vulnerability is present.
#
# Script typically utilizes curl, grep to determine if the open-redirect vulnerability is present
# 
# It will first attach payloads first to the full path to look for redirected page. After that, 
# it will attempt to attach the payload to each query string.
#

#        cat urls.txt | ./open_redirect_checker.sh 
# 
#    To check multiple URLs in parallel, run the command:
#        alias pparallel='parallel --will-cite -n1 --pipe '
#        cat in-urls.txt | pparallel ./open_redirect_checker.sh 1
