# pentest_open_redirect_checker
```
#!/bin/bash
# Script takes a number of URLs and attempts to check them for open-redirect using www.example.com
# as base, aka the payload is provided and if the example.com content seen in response, then it will 
# be assumed that open-redirect vulnerability is present.
#
# Script typically utilises curl, grep to determine if the open-redirect vulnerability is present
# 
# It will first attach payloads first to the full path to look for redirected page. After that, 
# it will attempt to attach the payload to each query string.
# 
# The payloads list has been taken from: 
#     https://github.com/payloadbox/open-redirect-payload-list
# 
# Input:
#     Multiple URLs, one on each line
# 
# Args:
#     verbose: This flag can be provided for debugging by setting to 1. By default, set to 1. To
#              stop, simply enter 0.
# 
# Output:
#     Vulnerable URLs, if found
# 
# Examples:
#    To check vulnerable URLs in list urls.txt, run the command:
#        cat urls.txt | ./open_redirect_checker.sh 
# 
#    To check multiple URLs in parallel, run the command:
#        alias pparallel='parallel --will-cite -n1 --pipe '
#        cat in-urls.txt | pparallel ./open_redirect_checker.sh 1
