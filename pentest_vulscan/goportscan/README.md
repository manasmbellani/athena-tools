# goportscan

This Go Script is used to run port scans via nmap, and identify particular 
protocols running on open ports through a custom signatures file

## Examples

### To discover open ports
To discover the ports for targets listed in file `targets.txt`, run the command:

```
$ cat targets.txt
www.google.com
www.hotmail.com

$ cat targets | sudo go run goportscan.go -skipUDP
[tcp] http://www.google.com:80
[tcp] https://www.google.com:443
[tcp] unknown://www.hotmail.com:100
[tcp] smb://www.hotmail.com:139
[tcp] https://www.hotmail.com:443
[tcp] smb://www.hotmail.com:445
```

### Run version scan and store results
To run a version scan on a target `www.google.com` and store the results in an 
output folder `out-nmap-www.google.com`

```
$ echo -e "www.google.com" | go run goportscan.go -skipUDP -runVersionScan -o out-nmap
[tcp] http://www.google.com:80
[tcp] https://www.google.com:443

$ cat out-nmap-www.google.com/out-grep-tcp.txt
Host: 172.217.167.68 (syd15s06-in-f4.1e100.net) Status: Up
Host: 172.217.167.68 (syd15s06-in-f4.1e100.net) Ports: 80/open/tcp//http//gws/, 443/open/tcp//ssl|https//gws/      Ignored State: filtered (998)
# Nmap done at Sun Jun 14 11:17:27 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 81.49 seconds
```

### Verbose mode and skip UDP scan
To show commands as they are executed when running on `www.google.com`, select `-verbose` flag and `-skipUDP` to skip UDP scanning

```
$ echo -e "www.google.com" | go run goportscan.go -skipUDP -verbose

## TODO
* TODO: Add the ability to write the raw results to output files
* TODO: Add `-sV` and `-A` OS scan options too
