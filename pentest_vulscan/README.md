#### GraphQL Testing
Typical Exploitation methods:
    * Extra info via debug? 
        ```/graphql?debug=1```
    Ref:https://blog.doyensec.com/2018/05/17/graphql-security-overview.html
    * Ability to see admin vs sensitive data
        * Access info available from admin then search it in restricted area e.g. licensekey??? E.g. license key??
    Ref: https://labs.detectify.com/2018/03/14/graphql-abuse/
    * Standard Injections?
        * Try something like valid-value `' OR 1=1 -- `
        * Use different quotes or quote escapings as well
    * Introspection?
        * via graphqlmap
        * via document explorer
            Exposed in `/graphiql` endpoint
            Taken from: https://github.com/righettod/poc-graphql#labs
        * via schema.json
            Exposed in /graphql/schema.json - bruteforce this path for .json files
    Taken from: https://github.com/righettod/poc-graphql#labs
    * Graphql/Graphiql exposures
        * See https://github.com/righettod/poc-graphql#labs
        * Start lab
```
git clone https://github.com/righettod/poc-graphql/ /opt/poc-graphql
cd /opt/poc-graphql
mvn spring-boot:run
```
    * Other Techniques
        * See graphqlmap
