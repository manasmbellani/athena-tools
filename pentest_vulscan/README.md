#### OAuth2.0 Testing: 
* Can OAuth2 `redirect_uri` be used to trick OAuth2 server into supplying a token to an attacker controlled location? Payloads provided below for testing where example.com is attacker-controlled domain. Taken from: https://nbsriharsha.blogspot.com/2016/04/oauth-20-redirection-bypass-cheat-sheet.html
